# The State of Northwind Trader Business - The Business Decision-Making Through Statistical Hypothesis Testing

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook will follow a few principles so dear reader will have an insightful and enjoyable time reading. The following are the five principles.

First, guide the reader through the journey with markers. Diagrams with steps will be provided at appropriate time to guide reader from start to end. Hopefully, this will be a great start.

Second, be consistent to presenting arguments. A case in point, the four hypothesis testing presented and statistical analysis here will consistent look-and-feel (e.g. consistent python command) that produces similar formatted results (of course, the t-values will be different, in this case). I will not be experimenting with different formats (I will save this for my own personal Jupyter Notebook, unless it is necessary (except hypothesis #4)

Third, as much as I can, I will provide a “So, what” into every key statement or analysis. This is important because the reader wants the linkage between your computation and analysis (seriously they really wants to know, I am one of them). I will ensure you will not be hang dry.

Fourth, there will be some revisit of statistical concepts prior to me jumping into certain key concepts.

Fifth, I will round things up with conclusion in every key sections.
